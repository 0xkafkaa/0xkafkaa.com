Its been two years on this perky little place on the internet. When I started this site I honestly had no clue about where this would lead me to but I always felt like I never belonged anywhere. Never really liked the traditional social media or the enshitificatin of those platforms in general. Trying to be visible around a plethora of voices never made sense to be anyway. That might be one of the key reasons for building this perky litte digital nest.

I never really cared whether people would be reading my writing and I still don't. But the innate need for validation as a social being stemming from our human nature brought about by the evolutionary advantage of belonging to a group could be one of the reasons I still might want people to read it. I know I am contradicting myself but I don't really care. Its your choice to read on, or not. With the diminishing attention span day after day, I doubt anyone's reading this anyway.

To live in a hype chasing reality where the genius brains of our generation are working on making people watch ads - the tragedy of incentives. I mean not the tech is bad - it's just that it's misaligned with deeper human aspirations, and all the cool products people are building are nothing but fancy LLM wrappers. I do embrace LLM - nothing against them, and enjoy vibe coding as well, will continue to do it as well. It might sound idiosyncratic but the level of abstraction we have achieved in computing right now kinda makes me eerie.
