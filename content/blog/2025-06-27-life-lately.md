Its been two years on this perky little place on the internet. When I started this site I honestly had no clue about where this would lead me to but I always felt like I never belonged anywhere. Never really liked the traditional social media or the enshitificatin of those platforms in general. Trying to be visible around a plethora of voices never made sense to be anyway. That might be one of the key reasons for building this perky litte digital nest.

I never really cared whether people would be reading my writing and I still don't. But the innate need for validation as a social being stemming from our human nature brought about by the evolutionary advantage of belonging to a group could be one of the reasons I still might want people to read it. I know I am contradicting myself but I don't really care - might be a paradox of expression. Its your choice to read on, or not. With the diminishing attention span day after day, I doubt anyone's reading this anyway.

To live in a hype chasing reality where the genius brains of our generation are working on making people watch ads - the tragedy of incentives. I mean not the tech is bad - it's just that it's misaligned with deeper human aspirations, and all the cool products people are building are nothing but fancy LLM wrappers. I do embrace LLM - nothing against them, and enjoy vibe coding as well, will continue to do it as well. It might sound idiosyncratic but the level of abstraction we have achieved in computing right now kinda makes me eerie.

I am trying to find answers to questions that would never mount to anything. This petit writing is as well one such quest for a simple question I was having i.e being mediocre with a impostor enhancement syndrome. 

Most people knows 'Vincent Van Gogh', some people likes him for his artworks. But I on the other hand likes Van Gogh for his writings. The following are some of his words from his letters.

> I would like to leave this world and never return. I severed my ear, but how I wish that I had severed by heart. I shall never amount to anything.

> In spite of everything, I shall rise again.

> What am I in the eyes of most people? A non-entity or an eccentric and a disagreeable man. I should want my work to show what is in the heart of such an eccentric, of a such a nobody.

> My opinion is that the best thing would be to work on till art lovers feel drawn towards it of their own accord, instead of having to praise or to explain it.

I am not sure whether you get it. But Van Gogh was right all along. Being mediocre, lost, and an eccentric is all just part of the process. Though he wasn't able to experience all the love he could wish for, he was right all along.
